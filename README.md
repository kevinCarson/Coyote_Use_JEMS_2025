# Coyote Use at the U.S.-Mexico Border from 1994 to 2010 using the Mexican Migration Project (MMP174)

This repository contains the necessary R scripts to replicate the inferential analysis in *Coyotaje in an Uncertain Social Environment: Prior Coyote Experience as a Form of Migration-Specific Human Capital*. The below description provides the name and the descipition for each dataset and R script. Please note that in order to replicate the analyses and create the post-processing dataset, please see the [Meso-American Migration Project](https://mmp.research.brown.edu/mmp) housed at Brown University, which was formally called the **Mexican Migration Project**. You will need to create an account to access the neccessary files. It's important to note that at the time of the inferential analyses presented in the manuscript, the current dataset was MMP174, where 174 denotes the number of communities sampled at the time.
